[Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty)
====================================
Configure jetty with extraClasspath property.

Configuration
-------------
Setup extraClasspath property in hotswap-agent.properties.

    #
    # Add this classpath prior to application classpath.
    # This may be useful for example in multi module maven project, where you do not need to build JAR file
    # after each change.
    #
    # Note that there must be a plugin that will provide actual replacement such as JettyPlugin for Jetty servlet container.
