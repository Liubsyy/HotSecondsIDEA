## Introduction
The HotSeconds plugin is mainly used for hot deployment to remote servers after writing the codes, with a response time in seconds. It provides one-key operation in all time, help you saving a significant amount of time for the modify->package->deploy cycle. This plugin is divided into HotSecondsClient and HotSecondsServer.<br>
At present, only JDK8 is supported.  In the future will consider supporting java11, java17 and other higher versions according to the demand.

#### Hot-deployment file range
support hot-deployment of all right-clicked files to the server, including java, .class files in jar, xml, html and other files, but path mapping needs to be configured for other files except java.<br>
#### Java hot reloading range
It supports code modification, add fields, add methods, and add classes. It also supports framework context updates such as Spring,SpringMVC and MyBatis.

## HotSecondsServer Installation
1.Upload HotSecondsServer.zip to the server , and run 'sh install.sh'<br>
2.Copy hot-seconds-remote.xml to the resource directory of the code, and modify configurations like 'secret' as needed<br>
3.Add the JVM parameter -XXaltjvm=dcevm -javaagent:$path1/HotSecondsServer.jar=hotconf=$path2/hot-seconds-remote.xml<br>
Here, $path1 is the directory uploaded in the step 1, and $path2 is the directory uploaded in the step 2.<br>
If it is a java or .class file, you donâ€™t need to add configuration, other files need to be filled<br>

## HotSecondsClient Installation
1.Download and install HotSecondsClient from the plugin marketplace<br>
2.Go to the menu Run->HotSeconds Settings->Settings to add the server to connect to and configure<br>
The 'secret' should match that of the remote server. By filling in the local and remote mapping paths, files in the local directory, including files in subfolders, can be uploaded to the remote server.<br>

<br>For instance, you can set shortcuts for HotSeconds Start/Stop and Hot swap this file.


## About extensions
This plug-in is not a panacea. After all, each company has its own framework, and there are so many open source frameworks on the market, but this plug-in is compatible with everything, and can expand the pre-logic and post-logic of uploading files. <br>
Copy IHotExtHandler.java in HotSecondsServer.zip to your project, implement this interface, and then configure your class name in hot-seconds-remote.xml, so that some logic that needs to refresh the cache and context can be done trigger.
